# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python 3 and the Tkinter library for building the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns as Player X and Player O. The interface consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons, where each player can mark their symbol ('X' or 'O') by clicking on an empty button. The game automatically checks for a winning condition after every move and displays the winner in a separate popup window. In case all boxes are filled and no player wins, the game announces a tie.

The game includes a "Quit" button, which prompts the user for confirmation before exiting the application to prevent accidental closures. Additionally, after a game ends (either by win or tie), the user is presented with an option to proceed, which closes the game windows.

To run this project, you must have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the Tkinter module, which usually comes pre-installed with Python. No additional libraries are required. You can run the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the Python file is saved, and typing the command python filename.py (replace filename.py with the actual name of your file, such as tic_tac_toe.py). This will launch the GUI window where you can start playing.

The game is easy to use and is intended for learning and practicing GUI programming in Python. It provides an interactive way to understand event handling, button widgets, labels, and message boxes in Tkinter. This project was created as a simple demonstration of how to build desktop applications using Python's built-in libraries without the need for any external dependencies.
